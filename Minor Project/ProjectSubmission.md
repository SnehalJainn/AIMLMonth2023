Summary(Optional) :   In this Python project, I utilized NumPy and Pandas for EDA and regression analysis. The project aimed to gain insights and build a regression model based on the dataset. During EDA, I explored the data, identified missing values/outliers, and examined variable relationships. Then, using libraries like scikit-learn, I trained a regression model to establish predictive relationships between variables. Model evaluation was performed using metrics like MSE or R-squared, assessing its fit and prediction capabilities. Overall, the project involved data manipulation, EDA, and regression analysis with NumPy and Pandas.
